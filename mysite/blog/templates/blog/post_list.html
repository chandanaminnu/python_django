         <p>Advantages of Django
            Here are few advantages of using Django which can be listed out here −

             Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Support − Django provides a bridge between the data model and the database
             engine, and
             supports a large set of database systems including MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, etc. Django also supports NoSQL
             database through Django-nonrel fork. For now, the only NoSQL databases supported are MongoDB and google app
             engine.

             Multilingual Support − Django supports multilingual websites through its built-in internationalization system.
             So you can develop your website, which would support multiple languages.

            Framework Support − Django has built-in support for Ajax, SS, Caching and various other frameworks.

            Administration GUI − Django provides a nice ready-to-use user interface for administrative activities.

            Development Environment − Django comes with a lightweight web server to facilitate end-to-end application
             development and testing.
